The role of validators is to run a full-node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by their private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work. They must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.</p> <h3 id="what-is-staking"><a href="#what-is-staking" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is 'staking'?</h3> <p>Dropil Chain is a public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, meaning that the weight of validators is determined by the amount of staked tokens (Drops) bonded as collateral. These Drops can be self-delegated directly by the validator or delegated to them by other Drop holders.</p> <p>Any user in the system can declare their intention to become a validator by sending a <code>create-validator</code> transaction. From there, they become validator candidates.</p> <p>The weight (i.e. voting power) of a validator determines whether or not they are an active validator. Initially, only the top 100 validators with the most voting power will be active validators.</p> <h3 id="what-is-a-full-node"><a href="#what-is-a-full-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a full-node?</h3> <p>A full-node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks of a blockchain. It is distinct from a light-node that only processes block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full-node requires more resources than a light-node but is necessary in order to be a validator. In practice, running a full-node only implies running a non-compromised and up-to-date version of the software with low network latency and without downtime.</p> <p>Of course, it is possible and encouraged for users to run full-nodes even if they do not plan to be validators.</p> <h3 id="what-is-a-delegator"><a href="#what-is-a-delegator" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a delegator?</h3> <p>Delegators are Drop holders who cannot, or do not want to run a validator themselves. Drop holders can delegate Drops to a validator and obtain a part of their revenue in exchange (for more detail on how revenue is distributed, see <a href="#what-is-the-incentive-to-stake"><strong>What is the incentive to stake?</strong></a> and <a href="#what-are-validators-commission"><strong>What are validators commission?</strong></a> sections below).</p> <p>Because they share revenue with their validators, delegators also share risks. Should a validator misbehave, each of their delegators will be partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stake. This is why delegators should perform due diligence on validators before delegating, as well as spreading their stake over multiple validators.</p> <p>Delegators play a critical role in the system, as they are responsible for choosing validators. Being a delegator is not a passive role: Delegators should actively monitor the actions of their validators and participate in governance. For more, read the <a href="delegators">delegators section</a>.</p> <h2 id="becoming-a-validator"><a href="#becoming-a-validator" class="header-anchor">#</a> Becoming a Validator</h2> <h3 id="how-to-become-a-validator"><a href="#how-to-become-a-validator" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to become a validator?</h3> <p>Any participant in the network can signal that they want to become a validator by sending a <code>create-validator</code> transaction, where they must fill out the following parameters:</p> <ul><li><strong>Validator's <code>PubKey</code>:</strong> The private key associated with this Tendermint <code>PubKey</code> is used to sign <em>prevotes</em> and <em>precommits</em>.</li> <li><strong>Validator's Address:</strong> Application level address. This is the address used to identify your validator publicly. The private key associated with this address is used to delegate, unbond, claim rewards, and participate in governance.</li> <li><strong>Validator's name (moniker)</strong></li> <li><strong>Validator's website <em>(optional)</em></strong></li> <li><strong>Validator's description <em>(optional)</em></strong></li> <li><strong>Initial commission rate</strong>: The commission rate on block rewards and fees charged to delegators.</li> <li><strong>Maximum commission:</strong> The maximum commission rate which this validator can charge. This parameter cannot be changed after <code>create-validator</code> is processed.</li> <li><strong>Commission max change rate:</strong> The maximum daily increase of the validator commission. This parameter cannot be changed after <code>create-validator</code> is processed.</li> <li><strong>Minimum self-delegation:</strong> Minimum amount of Drops the validator needs to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-delegated stake falls below this limit, their entire staking pool will unbond.</li></ul> <p>Once a validator is created, Drop holders can delegate Drops to them, effectively adding stake to their pool. The total stake of an address is the combination of Drops bonded by delegators and Drops self-bonded by the entity which designated themselves.</p> <p>Out of all validator candidates that signaled themselves, the 100 with the most total stake are the ones who are designated as validators. They become <strong>validators</strong> If a validator's total stake falls below the top 100 then that validator loses their validator privileges: they don't participate in consensus and generate rewards any more. Over time, the maximum number of validators will increase.</p> <h3 id="what-are-the-different-types-of-keys"><a href="#what-are-the-different-types-of-keys" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the different types of keys?</h3> <p>In short, there are two types of keys:</p> <ul><li><strong>Tendermint Key</strong>: This is a unique key used to sign consensus votes.
<ul><li>It is associated with a public key <code>dropvalconspub</code> (Get this value with <code>dropd tendermint show-validator</code>)</li> <li>It is generated when the node is created with dropd init.</li></ul></li> <li><strong>Application key</strong>: This key is created from <code>dropcli</code> and used to sign transactions. Application keys are associated with a public key prefixed by <code>droppub</code> and an address prefixed by <code>drop</code>. Both are derived from account keys generated by <code>dropcli keys add</code>.</li></ul> <p>Note: A validator's operator key is directly tied to an application key, but uses reserved prefixes solely for this purpose: <code>dropvaloper</code> and <code>dropvaloperpub</code></p> <h3 id="what-are-the-different-states-a-validator-can-be-in"><a href="#what-are-the-different-states-a-validator-can-be-in" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the different states a validator can be in?</h3> <p>After a validator is created with a <code>create-validator</code> transaction, they can be in three states:</p> <ul><li><code>in validator set</code>: Validator is in the active set and participates in consensus. Validator is earning rewards and can be slashed for misbehaviour.</li> <li><code>jailed</code>: Validator misbehaved and is in jail, i.e. outisde of the validator set. If the jailing is due to being offline for too long, the validator can send an <code>unjail</code> transaction in order to re-enter the validator set. If the jailing is due to double signing, the validator cannot unjail.</li> <li><code>unbonded</code>: Validator is not in the active set, and therefore not signing blocs. Validator cannot be slashed, and does not earn any reward. It is still possible to delegate Drops to this validator. Un-delegating from an <code>unbonded</code> validator is immediate.</li></ul> <h3 id="what-is-self-delegation-how-can-i-increase-my-self-delegation"><a href="#what-is-self-delegation-how-can-i-increase-my-self-delegation" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is 'self-delegation'?

This amount can be increases by sending a <code>delegate</code> transaction from your validator's <code>application</code> key.</p> <h3 id="is-there-a-minimum-amount-of-drops-that-must-be-delegated-to-be-an-active-bonded-validator"><a href="#is-there-a-minimum-amount-of-drops-that-must-be-delegated-to-be-an-active-bonded-validator" class="header-anchor">#</a> Is there a minimum amount of Drops that must be delegated to be an active (bonded) validator?</h3> <p>The minimum is <code>1 drop</code> or <code>1000000 udrop</code>.</p> <h3 id="how-will-delegators-choose-their-validators"><a href="#how-will-delegators-choose-their-validators" class="header-anchor">#</a> How will delegators choose their validators?</h3> <p>Delegators are free to choose validators according to their own subjective criteria. This said, criteria anticipated to be important include:</p> <ul><li><strong>Amount of self-delegated Drops:</strong> Number of Drops a validator self-delegated to themselves. A validator with a higher amount of self-delegated Drops has more skin in the game, making them more liable for their actions.</li> <li><strong>Amount of delegated Drops:</strong> Total number of Drops delegated to a validator. A high voting power shows that the community trusts this validator, but it also means that this validator is a bigger target for hackers. Bigger validators also decrease the decentralisation of the network.</li> <li><strong>Commission rate:</strong> Commission applied on revenue by validators before it is distributed to their delegators.</li> <li><strong>Track record:</strong> Delegators will likely look at the track record of the validators they plan to delegate to. This includes seniority, past votes on proposals, historical average uptime and how often the node was compromised.</li></ul> <p>Apart from these criteria, there will be a possibility for validators to signal a website address to complete their resume. Validators will need to build reputation one way or another to attract delegators. For example, it would be a good practice for validators to have their setup audited by third parties. Note though, that the Dropil team will not approve or conduct any audit themselves.

They should always be up-to-date with the current state of the ecosystem so that they can easily adapt to any change.</p> <h3 id="what-does-participate-in-governance-entail"><a href="#what-does-participate-in-governance-entail" class="header-anchor">#</a> What does 'participate in governance' entail?</h3> <p>Validators and delegators on Dropil Chain can vote on proposals to change operational parameters (such as the block gas limit), coordinate upgrades, or make a decision on any given matter.</p> <p>Validators play a special role in the governance system. Being the pillars of the system, they are required to vote on every proposal. It is especially important since delegators who do not vote will inherit the vote of their validator.</p> <h3 id="what-does-staking-imply"><a href="#what-does-staking-imply" class="header-anchor">#</a> What does staking imply?</h3> <p>Staking Drops can be thought of as a safety deposit on validation activities. When a validator or a delegator wants to retrieve part or all of their deposit, they send an <code>unbonding</code> transaction. Then, the Drops undergo a <strong>3 weeks unbonding period</strong> during which they are liable to being slashed for potential misbehaviors committed by the validator before the unbonding process started.</p> <p>Validators, and by association delegators, receive block rewards, fees, and have the right to participate in governance. If a validator misbehaves, a certain portion of their total stake is slashed. This means that every delegator that bonded Drops to this validator gets penalized in proportion to their bonded stake. Delegators are therefore incentivized to delegate to validators that they anticipate will function safely.</p> <h3 id="can-a-validator-run-away-with-their-delegators-drops"><a href="#can-a-validator-run-away-with-their-delegators-drops" class="header-anchor">#</a> Can a validator run away with their delegators' Drops?</h3> <p>By delegating to a validator, a user delegates voting power. The more voting power a validator has, the more weight they have in the consensus and governance processes. This does not mean that the validator has custody of their delegators' Drops. <strong>By no means can a validator run away with its delegator's funds</strong>.</p> <p>Even though delegated funds cannot be stolen by their validators, delegators are still liable if their validators misbehave.</p> <h3 id="how-often-will-a-validator-be-chosen-to-propose-the-next-block-does-it-go-up-with-the-quantity-of-bonded-drops"><a href="#how-often-will-a-validator-be-chosen-to-propose-the-next-block-does-it-go-up-with-the-quantity-of-bonded-drops" class="header-anchor">#</a> How often will a validator be chosen to propose the next block? Does it go up with the quantity of bonded Drops?</h3> <p>The validator that is selected to propose the next block is called the proposer. Each proposer is selected deterministically, and the frequency of being chosen is proportional to the voting power (i.e. amount of bonded Drops) of the validator. For example, if the total bonded stake across all validators is 100 Drops and a validator's total stake is 10 Drops, then this validator will proposer ~10% of the blocks.</p> <h3 id="will-validators-of-dropil-chain-ever-be-required-to-validate-other-zones-in-the-cosmos-ecosystem"><a href="#will-validators-of-dropil-chain-ever-be-required-to-validate-other-zones-in-the-cosmos-ecosystem" class="header-anchor">#</a> Will validators of Dropil Chain ever be required to validate other zones in the Cosmos ecosystem?</h3> <p>Yes, they will. If governance decides so, validators of Dropil Chain may be required to validate additional zones in the Cosmos ecosystem.</p> <h2 id="incentives"><a href="#incentives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Incentives</h2> <h3 id="what-is-the-incentive-to-stake"><a href="#what-is-the-incentive-to-stake" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the incentive to stake?</h3> <p>Each member of a validator's staking pool earns different types of revenue:</p> <ul><li><strong>Block rewards:</strong> Native tokens of applications run by validators (e.g. Drops on Dropil Chain) are inflated to produce block provisions. These provisions exist to incentivize Drop holders to bond their stake, as non-bonded Drop will be diluted over time.</li> <li><strong>Transaction fees:</strong> Dropil Chain maintains a whitelist of tokens that are accepted as fee payment. The initial fee token is the <code>drop</code>.</li></ul> <p>This total revenue is divided among validators' staking pools according to each validator's weight. Then, within each validator's staking pool the revenue is divided among delegators in proportion to each delegator's stake. A commission on delegators' revenue is applied by the validator before it is distributed.</p> <h3 id="what-is-the-incentive-to-run-a-validator"><a href="#what-is-the-incentive-to-run-a-validator" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the incentive to run a validator ?</h3> <p>Validators earn proportionally more revenue than their delegators because of commissions.</p> <p>Validators also play a major role in governance. If a delegator does not vote, they inherit the vote from their validator. This gives validators a major responsibility in the ecosystem.</p> <h3 id="what-are-validators-commission"><a href="#what-are-validators-commission" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are validators commission?</h3> <p>Revenue received by a validator's pool is split between the validator and their delegators. The validator can apply a commission on the part of the revenue that goes to their delegators. This commission is set as a percentage. Each validator is free to set their initial commission, maximum daily commission change rate and maximum commission. Dropil Chain enforces the parameter that each validator sets. Only the commission rate can change after the validator is created.</p> <h3 id="how-are-block-rewards-distributed"><a href="#how-are-block-rewards-distributed" class="header-anchor">#</a> How are block rewards distributed?</h3> <p>Block rewards are distributed proportionally to all validators relative to their voting power. This means that even though each validator gains Drops with each reward, all validators will maintain equal weight over time.</p> <p>Let us take an example where we have 10 validators with equal voting power and a commission rate of 1%. Let us also assume that the reward for a block is 1000 Drops and that each validator has 20% of self-bonded Drops. These tokens do not go directly to the proposer. Instead, they are evenly spread among validators. So now each validator's pool has 100 Drops. These 100 Drops will be distributed according to each participant's stake:</p> <ul><li>Commission: <code>100*80%*1% = 0.8 Drops</code></li> <li>Validator gets: <code>100\*20% + Commission = 20.8 Drops</code></li> <li>All delegators get: <code>100\*80% - Commission = 79.2 Drops</code></li></ul> <p>Then, each delegator can claim their part of the 79.2 Drops in proportion to their stake in the validator's staking pool.</p> <h3 id="how-are-fees-distributed"><a href="#how-are-fees-distributed" class="header-anchor">#</a> How are fees distributed?</h3> <p>Fees are similarly distributed with the exception that the block proposer can get a bonus on the fees of the block they propose if they include more than the strict minimum of required precommits.</p> <p>When a validator is selected to propose the next block, they must include at least 2/3 precommits of the previous block. However, there is an incentive to include more than 2/3 precommits in the form of a bonus. The bonus is linear: it ranges from 1% if the proposer includes 2/3rd precommits (minimum for the block to be valid) to 5% if the proposer includes 100% precommits. Of course the proposer should not wait too long or other validators may timeout and move on to the next proposer. As such, validators have to find a balance between wait-time to get the most signatures and risk of losing out on proposing the next block. This mechanism aims to incentivize non-empty block proposals, better networking between validators as well as to mitigate censorship.</p> <p>Let's take a concrete example to illustrate the aforementioned concept. In this example, there are 10 validators with equal stake. Each of them applies a 1% commission rate and has 20% of self-delegated Drops. Now comes a successful block that collects a total of 1025.51020408 Drops in fees.</p> <p>First, a 2% tax is applied. The corresponding Drops go to the reserve pool. Reserve pool's funds can be allocated through governance to fund bounties and upgrades.</p> <ul><li><code>2% * 1025.51020408 = 20.51020408</code> Drops go to the reserve pool.</li></ul> <p>1005 Drops now remain. Let's assume that the proposer included 100% of the signatures in its block. It thus obtains the full bonus of 5%.</p> <p>We have to solve this simple equation to find the reward R for each validator:</p> <p><code>9*R + R + R*5% = 1005 ⇔ R = 1005/10.05 = 100</code></p> <ul><li>For the proposer validator:
<ul><li>The pool obtains <code>R + R * 5%</code>: 105 Drops</li> <li>Commission: <code>105 * 80% * 1%</code> = 0.84 Drops</li> <li>Validator's reward: <code>105 * 20% + Commission</code> = 21.84 Drops</li> <li>Delegators' rewards: <code>105 * 80% - Commission</code> = 83.16 Drops (each delegator will be able to claim its portion of these rewards in proportion to their stake)</li></ul></li> <li>For each non-proposer validator:
<ul><li>The pool obtains R: 100 Drops</li> <li>Commission: <code>100 * 80% * 1%</code> = 0.8 Drops</li> <li>Validator's reward: <code>100 * 20% + Commission</code> = 20.8 Drops</li> <li>Delegators' rewards: <code>100 * 80% - Commission</code> = 79.2 Drops (each delegator will be able to claim their portion of these rewards in proportion to their stake)</li></ul></li></ul> <h3 id="what-are-the-slashing-conditions"><a href="#what-are-the-slashing-conditions" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the slashing conditions?</h3> <p>If a validator misbehaves, their delegated stake will be partially slashed. There are currently two faults that can result in slashing of funds for a validator and their delegators:</p> <ul><li><strong>Double signing:</strong> If someone reports on chain A that a validator signed two blocks at the same height on chain A and chain B, and if chain A and chain B share a common ancestor, then this validator will get slashed by 5% on chain A.</li> <li><strong>Downtime:</strong> If a validator misses more than 95% of the last 10,000 blocks, they will get slashed by 0.01%.</li></ul> <h3 id="do-validators-need-to-self-delegate-drops"><a href="#do-validators-need-to-self-delegate-drops" class="header-anchor">#</a> Do validators need to self-delegate Drops?</h3> <p>Yes, they do need to self-delegate at least <code>1 drop</code>. Even though there is no obligation for validators to self-delegate more than <code>1 drop</code>, delegators should want their validator to have more self-delegated Drops in their staking pool. In other words, validators should have skin in the game.</p> <p>In order for delegators to have some guarantee about how much skin-in-the-game their validator has, the latter can signal a minimum amount of self-delegated Drops. If a validator's self-delegation goes below the limit that it predefined, this validator and all of its delegators will unbond.</p> <h2 id="technical-requirements"><a href="#technical-requirements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Technical Requirements</h2> <h3 id="what-are-hardware-requirements"><a href="#what-are-hardware-requirements" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are hardware requirements?</h3> <p>Validators should expect to provision one or more data center locations with redundant power, networking, firewalls, HSMs and servers.</p> <p>We expect that a modest level of hardware specifications will be needed initially and that they might rise as network use increases. Participating in the testnet is the best way to learn more.</p> <p>For now, we recommend a server with at least 8GB of RAM and 500GB of storage (SSD recommended, but not mandatory).

A validator node will typically run in a data center. Most data centers provide direct links the networks of major cloud providers. The validator can use those links to connect to sentry nodes in the cloud. This shifts the burden of denial-of-service from the validator's node directly to its sentry nodes, and may require new sentry nodes be spun up or activated to mitigate attacks on existing ones.</p> <p>Sentry nodes can be quickly spun up or change their IP addresses. Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an internet based attacked cannot disturb them directly. This will ensure validator block proposals and votes always make it to the rest of the network.</p> <p>It is expected that good operating procedures on that part of validators will completely mitigate these threats.</p> <p>For more on sentry node architecture, see <a href="https://forum.cosmos.network/t/sentry-node-architecture-overview/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article on the Cosmos forums<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> .</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
